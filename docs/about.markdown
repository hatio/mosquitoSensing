# Motivation

Pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes cause over one million deaths each year. Low-middle income countries (LMIC) in the tropics disproportionately suffer this burden. With the lack of safe and effective vaccines against many of these pathogens, resource-intensive mosquito control is the sole actionable intervention. 

Mosquito habitats are highly heterogeneously distributed, with substantial variation in abundance across a community and over a year. This variability hampers our ability to target mosquitoes effectively, with e.g., insecticides. We urgently need an ability to identify in real time, the presence and abundance of mosquitoes, within any setting, including an ability to identify specific species that could act as a disease vector. Currently public health officials rely on laborious mosquito trapping, which can only realistically be conducted in a small number of locations.

Leveraging wingbeat frequencies signatures of mosquito species, automated sensor-based technologies can offer scalable solutions to monitor species-specific mosquito abundance. This project is designed to fill in critical evidence gaps impeding decisions to adopt the technology as well as generate prototypes of resources to enable real-world implementation of the technology and solidify future directions in developing these prototypes into real-world solutions.


# The Team

This project is an interdisciplinary, cross-sector collaboration between:
- local public health officials at Na MoungPhet Municipality
- local public health entomologists at VBDCC, Trang,
- public health academics from SCPH,
- computer scientists at Mahidhol University, and
- infectious disease epidemiologists at University of Cambridge.
